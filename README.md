# residency01

## Residency intro

During my first month on balena I'll be doing a residency on the balenaLabs team. This means that I can choose any project I want and have a month to develop it! The main goal of the project is to do the onboarding process ( get acquainted with the way things work around here ) in a fun and productive way. 


> Note that _the aim of the Residency is to get a project onto balenaHub and a blog post published. [...]We do need to get (at least an MVP of) a working, usable project onto Hub. What we want to avoid is making proof of concepts, or example repos - but nothing actually useful_.

The first task is to decide what to work on. I have defined some restrictions or own goals about the project I'm about to start working on:

1) Must be something that is interesting to me
2) Doesn't have to result in a "product" of any kind
3) But I want to "finish" it, so I'd like to have a set of goals or stages and try to get as far as I can
4) It should be a way to learn the way the balena platform works: how to develop an app, maintain a fleet, what are the "reusable components" on the platform
5) Have something original: it may be a mashup of ideas, but not a clone of some other projects
6) Would be nice to include some hardware to use on a PI.


## Labs residency ideas

Ok, first: my interests:

I like to work ( or explore working ) on:

1) networked data, distributed computing
  - In balena terms, this could mean developing an app that makes sense to deploy to a fleet, as in a set of workers that are coordinated.
2) asynchronous processing, stream processing
  - processing data asynchronously, processing a stream as a way to both simplify complexity and provide scalability with a unified model. Somehow related to the one above

SDR related projects:

3) AM/FM radio
  - SDR: I have an SDR, but I haven't got time ( or just sat down ) to do anything besides some small toying with it
4) GPS
  - Would be good to understand how does it actually work, in terms of processing radio signals from satellites. And how does the "interpolation" actually works? Everyone has a GPS on their phone or watch but how does this tiny device work?

## Exploration

Options 1 and 2 were discarded because I couldn't come up with a project that cover requisites 3 and specially 6.

I spent most of my time around exploring ideas for options 3 and 4: Using SDR ( what can I do with it ) and specially on AM/FM radio

I did some exploration on option 4 ( GPS ). But I think I would spend too much time understanding the way the protocol works, maybe copying from som implementation, and would be difficult to come with a plan ( req 3 ). 



### SDR

So I went to the web and found this nice summary:

**What can you do with SDR?**

	You can do various different things using an SDR as follows:

	Receive broadcast radio
	Amateur radio
	Radio astronomy
	Track ships via AIS transmissions
	Track aircraft via Mode S transmissions
	Set up a DRM transmitter
		https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_Radio_Mondiale
	Build a GSM network
	Experiment with LTE
	Learn how Global Navigation Satellite Systems work
		https://gnss-sdr.org/


I explored several of the ones above

- AM/FM radio receiver
- GPS ( "Global Navigation satellite systems" )
- Track Aircraft or ships

And discarded others:

- Amateur radio: broadcasting. Doesn't sound too much fun.
- LTE / GSM : most of what I found was around "hacking" which is not quite interesting and is too detailed and probably old since these technologies move too fast
- Radio astronomy: not my cup of tea  

## Previous projects

I wanted to share these ideas with the team to get feedback, references and just to show that I was actually doing something ðŸ˜…


>#status

>Doing a bit of exploring around ideas for the residency project. I'm currently looking into candidate ideas for a project related to Software-defined radio SDR. Has anybody done something similar? Example projects: an aircraft carried like flightradar24.  Most applications already exist so I'm thinking the project would be around packing and using balena to distribute the app, or maybe something innovative around using a fleet? ( most apps are targeted to using 1 device )

>Or something related to radio ( AM/FM ) like recreating a legacy radio using a physical knob to "move" the dial and show a graphical UI.

I got back an awesome set of references!

* SDR: An spectrum visualization https://hub.balena.io/gh_jaomaloy/balena-rtl-power by Jao Maloloy-on `@jaomaloy`

This project has a **great** GitHub page: https://github.com/jaomaloy/balena-rtl-power/blob/main/README.md excellent intro, motivation, architecture, how tos. I hope to make mine like this one. 

It uses the [rtl-power](http://kmkeen.com/rtl-power/) project ; I was playing with [rtl-fm](http://kmkeen.com/rtl-demod-guide/) from the same dev.


* A flight traffic app on Hub here: https://hub.balena.io/ketil/balena-ads-b

This is a "downloadable base station for FlightAware", using balena. Awesome. Well, this was one of my ideas ( see the notes below ) but since it already exists as a project on the balena hub, I better find something else to work on.

* A Pi **traansmitter*  Cool if you want to broadcast FM! https://hub.balena.io/grokbeer/rickroll-fm https://github.com/grokbeer/rickroll-fm

* Alan Boris @alab128 did a great project that allows you to use OpenWebRX to listen to some frequencies and visualize the radio spectrum, packed as a balena app https://www.balena.io/blog/running-openwebrx-on-balena-to-remotely-monitor-local-radio-spectrum/

This has a great how-to page, I followed the intructions and was playing with it locally in no time


* WAT!! A "Sound cabinet" https://balenaltd.io/rosswesleyporter/blog/make-the-extra-small-model/  This is excellent and beautiful, a cabinet where we can put the Pi. I could use this or an old radio. Or both.



So that's for the references.

I'm now focused on defined the project:


## AM/FM Radio


Wouldn't it be great to have a Raspberry Pi based AM/FM/SW radio?

- I could start with a Pi + a SDR dongle.
- Then connect the Pi to a speaker -> boom we have sound
- I could add a rotary switch ( now that I know how they're called ) to tune the radio and a potentiometer to control the volume
- I have several options for displays:
  - A simple frequency display with a 7-segment LED
  - A graphycal display that resembles an analog radio dial 
- I could have "radio preset" buttons
- I could have a "tuning level" indicator if I somehow manage to detect how far from the signal the currently selected frequency is

What I like about this:

- Would need to handle the input from hardware
- I can put the Pi in an old radio cabinet 

Challenges:

- There's a challenge on how to change the tuning frequency. Some of the apps I've played with ( cmd line tools, openwebrx ) require you to select a frequency and run the app. But there's not input to change the frequency like you do when rorating the knob on a radio. maybe I need to import a library and work from there
- I haven't programmed a display since I was a kid. Like in moving sprites, displaying vectors etc. Would be a nice opportunity to program on this. Also, I'm very bad at graphical design or anything related to that

  It could play local AM and FM radio, AND also internet radio. All in one!
      we can apply filters
      we can do an "auto-tune" feature

## RANDOM NOTES


Well on the balenaOS I don't have apt-get or anything like that, so I'm trying to run on the intel nuc which has linux and then try to build the image


balenaSound

ross porter has plans for wood case



### My hardware


https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0747PX3NZ/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o03_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1

Nooelec NESDR Smart HF Bundle: 100kHz-1.7GHz Software Defined Radio Set for HF/UHF/VHF Including RTL-SDR, Assembled Ham It Up Upconverter, Balun, Adapters

Manufacturer	Nooelec Inc.
ASIN	B0747PX3NZ
Item model number	NooElec NESDR SMArt HF Bundle

NE SDR natively covers 25 MHz to 1.7 GHz. You need to use the upconverter to receive below 25 MHz. You also need to put a -125 Mhz offset in the SDR software. Once you do you can receive HF Ham Stuff and shortwave.


ON the NUC:
rtl_tcp -a 192.168.0.3


qcrx on the mac: 
Use the device argument 'rtl_tcp=192.168.0.3:1234' in OsmoSDR (gr-osmosdr) source
to receive samples in GRC and control rtl_tcp parameters (frequency, gain, ...).

This worked on mac 10.12; newers need a more modern version
